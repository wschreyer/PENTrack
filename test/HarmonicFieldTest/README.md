Harmonic field test
=============

This test uses a magnetic field generated from a harmonic polynomial expansion.
It then runs PENTrack to print a cut through the field. There is a version of
this directory that contains an iPython notebook for displaying and 
interrogating the test results, located at:

https://github.com/jonahberean/harmonic_field_test_in_PENTrack

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
