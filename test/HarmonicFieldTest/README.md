Harmonic field test
=============

This test uses a magnetic field generated from a harmonic polynomial expansion.
It then runs PENTrack to print a cut through the field.
The cut is then shown in a 3D scatter plot.

TO DO: 
- testing various homogenous fields
- testing rotations and offsets

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
