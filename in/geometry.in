############# How to use STL-files ############
# STL files use a list of triangles to describe 3D-surfaces (see here for file format: http://www.ennex.com/~fabbers/StL.asp)
# They can be created with Solidworks via "Datei - Speichern unter... - Dateityp STL - Save"
# Note the "Optionen..." button in the Save dialog, there you can change format (only binary supported), resolution, coordinate system etc.
# If you want to export several parts of an Solidworks assembly you can do the following (if you know a nicer/easier way, please add it here)
# - select the part(s) to be exported and rightclick
# - select "Auswahl invertieren" and then use "Unterdrücken" on all other parts
# - WARNING! You might not be able to undo the "Unterdrücken"-command but have to reload the assembly, so save any changes before that!
# - now you can save that single part as STL (make sure the option "STL-Ausgabedaten nicht auf positiven Raum übertragen" is checked
#		and to use the same coordinate system for every part or else the different parts will not fit together)
# You can check the positioning of the parts with Minimagics (http://www1.materialise.com/materialise/view/en/2562719-MiniMagics.html)
# 	(Minimagics needs a looong time to start (~1min), so be patient. It may also report errors where are none, you can check for errors
#	by opening the STL file with Solidworks)
# Solidworks makes sure that the surface normals always point outside a solid body (you can check that with MiniMagics, too: Solid bodies
#	("shells") should be marked red). This is used to check if the source volume overlaps with other solids so that no particle is created
#	inside a solid body.
# memory consumption of loading STL-files into program is about 5 times the file size
