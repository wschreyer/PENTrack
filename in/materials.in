# imaginary Fermi potential, diffuse reflectivity, spin flip probability, micro-roughness parameters, internal magnetic field, microfacet distribution width
# Diffuse reflection is either modeled with a Lambert model (scattering angle cosine-distributed around surface normal),
#  a modified Lambert model (scattering angle cosine-distributed around specular-scattering vector), or the Micro Roughness model.
# To activate either Lambert model, set the (modified) Lambert-reflection probability. To activate micro roughness, set RMSroughness and CorrelationLength.
# See https://doi.org/10.1080/10448639208218770 and https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/
# For more information on diffuse reflection see https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01380066 and https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/i2010-10926-x
# Additionally, a wavelength-dependent Beckmann distribution of surface microfacets can be included. The Beckmann distribution width is calculated with
#  width = microfacetDistributionWidth*(neutron wavelength [nm]/cos(incident angle))^microfacetDistributionWidthExponent, see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.108.034605
#
# When a neutron hits a surface, the code randomly chooses to flip its spin based on the given spin flip probability.
# Then it calculates the potential difference between the previous and the new material, taking into account the spin polarization and internal magnetic fields.
# Based on the potential difference and the diffuse-reflection parameters it chooses if the neutron should be transmitted or reflected specularly or diffusely.
