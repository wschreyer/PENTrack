PENTrack
========

PENTrack - a simulation tool for ultracold neutrons, protons and electrons

The stable releases are quite outdated. The new release described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2017.03.036) is coming up soon.


Prerequisites
-----------

### CMake

CMake 3.1 or newer is required to build PENTrack.

### Compiler

A C++11-compatible compiler is required.

GCC 4.7.2 and newer should work. GCC 4.8.2 seems to break the CGAL library on some machines and can cause particles flying through walls.

### Boost

The [Boost C++ libraries](https://www.boost.org/) are a prerequisite for the CGAL library. Additionally, the simulation uses the [odeint integrator](http://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/) included in Boost 1.53.0 and newer. Boost is included in most Linux OSs; should you need to download and compile it manually, you may have to adjust the search path of cmake by calling cmake with `-DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost`.

Boost 1.53.0 - 1.69.0 have been tested. Boost 1.64.0 is unusable as it contains [a bug](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/12516) that prevents compiling PENTrack.

### GMP and MPFR

GMP 4.2 and MPFR 2.2.1 (or newer) are required for the CGAL library. They should be available on almost all Linux distributions.

Included libraries
------------------

### CGAL

The [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](http://www.cgal.org/) provides axis-aligned bounding-box (AABB) trees to quickly detect collisions of particle tracks with the experiment geometry defined by triangle meshes. It also provides lots of routines to check those meshes for errors.

CGAL 4.14 is included in the repository.

### ExprTk

The [C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library](http://partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html) is a fast formula parser and is used to interpret user-defined formulas in configuration files.

It is included in the repository.

### ALGLIB

[ALGLIB](http://www.alglib.net) is used to do 1D and 2D interpolation for field calculations.
It also provides numerical optimization and integration routines required for the MicroRoughness model for UCN interaction with matter.

It is included in the repository.

### libtricubic

[Lekien and Marsden](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.1296) developed a tricubic interpolation method in three dimensions. It is included in the repository.


Defining your experiment
------------------------

### Configuration files

Simulation parameters are defined the configuration file config.in. By default, it is located in the `in` directory. The config files are separated into sections with their headers indicated in square brackets. Each line consists of a variable name followed by an arbitrary number of values separated by whitespace characters.

General simulation parameters are defined in the GLOBAL section. Materials and geometry are defined in the MATERIALS and GEOMETRY sections. The former can optionally be moved into a different file, e.g. a central materials database. Electromagnetic fields and particle sources are defined in the FIELDS, and SOURCE sections. Particle-specific parameters - lifetime, output options, etc. - are either defined for all particle types in the PARTICLES section or in the specific particle sections. Some parameters require user-defined formulas that can be defined in the FORMULAS section.

More information can be found in the provided default configuration file `in/config.in`.

The default configuration simulates a full cycle of the neutron-lifetime experiment [PENeLOPE](http://www.e18.ph.tum.de/research/measuring-the-neutron-lifetime-penelope/). It is filled with UCN from a source in the guide below the storage volume for 200s and higher-energy UCN are removed by absorbers for 200s. Then, PENeLOPE's superconducting magnets are ramped up and UCN are stored for 200s. Afterwards, the magnet is ramped down again and remaining UCN are counted in a detector below the storage volume. During magnetic storage, spins of the UCNs are simulated to estimate their probability to flip.

### Geometry

Geometry can be imported using [binary STL files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29).
STL files use a list of triangles to describe 3D-surfaces. They can be created with most CAD software, e.g. Solidworks via "File - Save As..." using the STL file type. Note the "Options..." button in the Save dialog, there you can change format (only binary supported), resolution, coordinate system etc.

**PENTrack expects the STL files to be in unit Meters.**

**Gravity acts in negative z-direction, so choose your coordinate system accordingly.**

Do not choose a too high resolution. Spatial tolerances of 1mm to 3mm and angle tolerances of 10 degrees are usually good enough. Low tolerances quickly increase triangle count. Unless you have very complicated parts, the resulting STL files typically have file sizes of less than 1 MB.

PENTrack will warn you of potential issues in triangle meshes (holes, self-intersections). If you get such warnings, check if the summary at the end of the simulation lists particles that encountered geometry errors. If it does, you might want to fix the affected meshes by simplifying parts, re-exporting with different resolution, or repairing them in e.g. [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/).

If you want to export parts of a Solidworks assembly you can do the following:

1. Select the part(s) to be exported and right-click.
2. Select "Invert selection" and hide all other parts.
3. Now you can save the remaining parts in either a single STL file or each part in a separate file. Make sure the option "Do not translate STL output data to positive space" is checked and to use the same coordinate system for every part, else they will not fit together. For resolution, the "Fine" preset is usually a good choice.
4. You can check the positioning of the parts with e.g. [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/), SolidView, Minimagics, Solidworks...

### Fields

Magnetic and electric fields (2D and 3D) can be included from text-based field maps.
2D maps are assumed to be rotationally symmetric around the z axis. They can contain columns for r, z, Bx, By, Bz, Ex, Ey, Ez, and V exported from "[Vectorfields OPERA](http://www.operafea.com)" on a regular grid (each field column is optional).

3D maps can contain generic columns for x, y, z, Bx, By, Bz on a rectilinear grid. Lines beginning with % or # will be skipped, columns may be delineated by space, comma, or tab.
3D maps can also be exported from OPERA with columns x, y, z, Bx, By, Bz, V on a rectilinear grid (each field column is optional).

Units of field maps are assumed to be in meters, Tesla, and Volts, but each can be scaled individually.

You can also define a variety of analytically calculated fields. See default config file and test/analyticalFieldTest/config.in for more information.

Every field type can be scaled with a user-defined time-dependent formula to simulate oscillating fields or magnets that are ramped up and down. The formula can be defined in the FORMULAS section.

### Particle sources

Particle sources randomly generate the initial conditions of simulated particles according to several user-defined distributions:

#### Energy distribution

In a first step, the spectrum defined in the config file is randomly sampled to define the particle's initial kinetic energy.

#### Time distribution

Second, the starting time is uniformly sampled from the periods during which the source is active (can be a continuous or pulsed source).

#### Spatial distribution

Third, the starting coordinates are randomly selected from a volume defined either by coordinate ranges or by an STL file. When using a volume source the starting positions are uniformly distributed within the volume. When using a surface source the starting positions are selected on the surfaces of the simulated geometry that are contained within the volume.

#### Phase space weighting (only available for volume sources)

Following the previous steps, the energy, time, and spatial distributions are uncorrelated. However, if an ensemble of particles is in thermodynamic equilibrium with a non-uniform and time-dependent potential the phase space available to a particle with total energy H shrinks as the potential V increases, leading to a spatial distribution that is correlated with energy and time. To replicate such a situation when simulating a volume source, phase space weighting can be enabled in the config. If phase space weighting is enabled the user-defined spectrum is sampled to select the initial **total energy**. Then, a starting time t and position x are sampled as described above but only accepted with the probability sqrt( (H - V(x, t)) / (H - Vmin) ). If the starting point is rejected these steps are repeated until a starting point is eventually accepted (rejection sampling).

For this scheme, the potential minimum Vmin in the source volume is needed. Hence, if phase space weighting is enabled the source volume is randomly sampled many times when starting the simulation to approximately determine the potential minimum.

#### Velocity distribution

In a final step, the azimuth and polar angle (with respect to the z axis) of the particle's initial velocity are randomly sampled. For a volume source the angles are sampled from the distributions defined in the config file. Note that the solid angle scales as dΩ = sin(θ) dθ dφ, e.g. for an isotropic distribution the polar angle θ needs to follow a sin(θ) distribution. For a surface source the angles follow [Lambert's cosine law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_cosine_law). In addition, surface sources can add a velocity boost normal to the surface, replicating a situation where the particle gains energy when crossing the surface. This additional energy will be added on top of the initial energy sampled from the spectrum.


Limitations
-----------

The description of geometry through triangle meshes incurs certain limitations:
- STL files use single-precision floating-point numbers, limiting their relative precision to about 1e-7. So if your geometry has a typical size of 1m, features smaller than 1um will not be well represented.
- Triangle meshes can only approximate curved surfaces. Curved surfaces that are supposed to be touching will in most cases not do so in the simulations and instead leave holes in your geometry. You should rather overlap such surfaces and make sure the tolerance during STL export is smaller than the overlap.
- Collision points with the geometry are iterated by interpolating the particle trajectory between steps. For very fast particles the precision of this interpolation is limited by rounding errors and the iterated collision point can be offset by 10s of micrometers for highly relativstic particles.

Run the simulation
------------------

Type `cmake .` to create a Makefile, execute `make` to compile the code, then run the executable `PENTrack`. Some information will be shown during runtime. Log files (start- and end-values, tracks and snapshots of the particles) will be written to the /out/ directory, depending on the options chosen in the configuration file.

Four optional command-line parameters can be passed to the executable: a job number (default: 0) which is prepended to all log-file names, a path from where the configuration file should be read (default: in/), a path where the output files will be written (default: out/), and a fixed random seed (default: 0 - random seed is determined from high-resolution clock at program start).


Physics
-------

All particles use the same relativistic equation of motion, including gravity, Lorentz force and magnetic force on their magnetic moment.

Interaction of UCN with matter is described with the Fermi-potential formalism. Diffuse scattering is described with the [Lambert model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_cosine_law) (scattering angle cosine-distributed around surface normal), a modified Lambert model (scattering angle cosine-distributed around specular scattering vector), or the MicroRoughness model (see [Z. Physik 254, 169--188 (1972)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01380066) and [Eur. Phys. J. A 44, 23-29 (2010)](http://ucn.web.psi.ch/papers/EPJA_44_2010_23.pdf)). Additionally, a wavelength-dependent Beckmann distribution of surface microfacets can be defined (see [Phys Rev. C 108, 034605 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.108.034605). Spin flips on wall bounce can also be included. Protons and electrons do not have any interaction so far, they are just stopped when hitting a wall.

A particle's spin can be tracked by integrating the [Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10701-011-9579-7) equation along a particle's trajectory. To reduce computation time a magnetic-field threshold can be defined to limit spin tracking to regions where the adiabatic condition is not fulfilled.


Writing your own simulation
---------------------------

You can modify the simulation on four different levels:

1. Modify the configuration file and use the implemented particles, sources, fields, etc. (more info below and in the default config.in file)
2. Modify the code in main.c and combine TParticle, TGeometry, TField, TSource classes etc. into your own simulation (you can generate a Doxygen documentation by typing `doxygen doxygen.config`)
3. Implement your own particles, sources or fields by inheriting from the corresponding base classes and fill the virtual routines with the corresponding physics
4. Make low level changes to the existing classes

Code tests can be compiled by adding the BUILD_TESTS option to cmake: `cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON .`. `make` will then compile an additional executable `runTests` that will report any failed code tests. The Boost Unit Test Framework from version 1.59.0 or newer will be required to build the tests.


Output
-------

The output is separated by particle type, (e.g. electron, neutron and proton) and type of output (endlog, tracklog, ...). Output files are only created if particles of the specific type are simulated and can also be individually configured for each particle type by adding corresponding variables in the particle-specific sections in the configuration file.

The format of output files can be selected with the logtype variable in the config. If you select text output (the default) one file with space-separated columns is created for each particle and output type; the first line contains the column name. If you compile PENTrack with [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) support, data can be directly printed to ROOT trees. If you compile PENTrack with [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) support, data can be logged to HDF5 files. In each case, a single file containing datasets for each particle and output type will be created. The file will also contain a copy of all configuration variables.

Output can be filtered so only particles fulfilling certain conditions are printed, see the logvars and logfilter variables in the config.

Types of output: endlog, tracklog, hitlog, snapshotlog, spinlog.

### Endlog

The endlog keeps track of the starting and end parameters of the simulated particles. The data to be output can be defined with the endlogvars option in the config file.

Helper Scripts 
--------------

### Merging output files into ROOT trees

merge_all.c: A [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch) script that writes all out-files (or those, whose filenames match some pattern) into a single ROOT file containing trees for each log- and particle-type.

merge.py: Python script merging all files given as parameters into a ROOT tree, similar to merge_all.c.

### Submitting PENTrack jobs to a computing cluster

slurm.sh: An example script showing how to submit PENTrack simulations as an array of jobs running in parallel to a computing cluster using the [SLURM scheduler](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).

### preRunCheck.sh (DEPRECATED --- needs update)

This script performs some preliminary checks before launching a large batch PENTrack job. The checks performed are:

1. Check that the STL files referenced in the configuration file exist (i.e. there is no mistake in the path specified in the [GEOMETRY] section of the file.
2. Checks that all the files in the STL folder are referenced in the [GEOMETRY] section of the configuration file (currently the script looks for a folder name STL this could be made general later)
3. Checks if the number of jobs running would exceed 2880 when the batch file being generated is submitted (2880 is the maximum number of jobs allowed to be running by a single user on [Westgrid's](https://www.westgrid.ca/) [Jasper](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/systems/Jasper/) cluster). The number 2880 could be changed directly in the code depending on a different user requirement.
4. Check if the job numbers being specified in the batch file being generated would overwrite the jobs that already exist in the output directory. A warning is given if there are cases of overwrite and the job numbers affected by the overwrite are given. 

The script also generates a batch.pbs that can be submitted to a TORQUE queueing system. The batch script can be customized by entering the following command line input in this order: 

1. minJobNum - the lower bound of the job array id specified in the batch file (default is 1) 
2. maxJobNum - the upper bound of the job array id specified in the batch file (default is 10, so if minJobNum=1 and maxJobNum=10, submitting the batch file would result in 10 PENTrack jobs being run the job numbers ranging from 1-10)
3. jobName - the name of the job that will displayed when you check the status of the jobs using the `qstat` command (default is SampleRun)
4. inDirName - the relative path to the directory containing PENTrack's input files (the geometry.in file in this directory will be checked, default is in/)
5. outDirName - the relative path to the directory where the job output will be written (the cases for overwriting previous jobs will be checked in this directory, default is out/)
6. pbsfileName - the name of the batch file being generated (default name is batch.pbs)
7. wallTime - the walltime requested from the queueing system, it must be entered in the following format: 1d4h30m which means the time requested is: 1 day + 4 hours + 30 minutes (you can only specify days or hours or minutes but they order must remain: day, hours, minutes). You can also specify 120m and the batch file will correctly set the time to 2 hours. A warning will be given 

### postRunCheck.sh (DEPRECATED --- neds update)

This script performs some basic error checks after a batch run of PENTrack has finished execution. The two required inputs are: 

1. expectedNumJobs - the number of jobs that were part of the batch run which is to be checked
2. outDirName - the relative path to the output directory where the output from the batch run was written 

The checks performed by the script are: 

1. Lists the number of each type of log file present in the outDirName directory so that you can verify the correct number of log files are produced 
2. Lists the number of empty and non-empty error files and the job numbers for the non-empty error files so you can identify jobs that encountered problems. Currently, the error files are expected to be named error.txt-jobNum where jobNum is an integer, ex: error.txt-1, error.txt-2 etc...
3. Lists the number of output files that had an exit code so you can identify the number of jobs that ran to completion, and the number of jobs that had an exit code of 0 so you can verify the number of jobs that finished normally. A list of the job numbers that did not finish i.e. did not have an exit code and a list of the job numbers that did not have an exit code of 0 is also provided. 
4. Creates a directory named ErrorJobs in the outDirName directory and moves all the files related to a job number with a non-empty error file, file without an exit code and files without an exit code of 0 to the ErrorJobs directory. 
5. Generates a table listing the average, minimum and maximum values of the following simulation parameters: Simulation time, Particle Stop IDS (neutron absorbed on a surface, Neutrons absorbed in a material, Neutrons not categorized etc...). The job numbers corresponding to the jobs with the maximum and minimum values for each parameter are given. This table is useful in making sure there are not too many neutrons encountering geometry errors or hitting the outer boundaries or identifying a job number that had particularly large numbers of neutrons encounter an error etc. 

### genGeomList.sh (DEPRECATED --- neds update)

This script generates a list of STL files in the format required by PENTrack, priority and material type defined. This is useful when running a simulation with a large number of STL files required. However, to function the STL files must be named according to a specific naming convention for regular files the convention is: 

 partName_mater_CuBe_prior_1.stl

where CuBe specifies the mater(ial) and 1 specifies the PENTrack priority to be assigned to the part. If the part corresponds to a source volume the naming convention is :

 partName_prior_source.stl

If the file doesn't contain the keyword mater then the STL file will still be displayed in the output but the material will be given as MISSING_MATERIAL. Also, if the material is specified as NotUsed (case insensitive) then file will not be listed in the output. 

The output from the script is directed to standard out is meant to be copied into the configuration file. The file also takes an optional argument: 

1. stlDirName - path to the directory containing the STL files that are to be processed
