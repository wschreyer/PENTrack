Harmonic field test
=============

This test uses a magnetic field generated from a harmonic polynomial expansion.
It then runs PENTrack to print a cut through the field.
The cut is then shown in a 3D scatter plot.

TO DO: 
- Make B-field cuts that interrogate the simplified (homogenous) expressions 
    for the harmonic polynomial expansion. A series of cuts on these fields
    should correspond to our expectations
- Make a bunch of rotations, confirm that the results for both B, and dBidxj
    make sense. 
- Rotate one way, and then rotate back the other way. Check that everything 
    coincides as expected.
- Contact Wolfgang Klassen, begin testing with UCN

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
