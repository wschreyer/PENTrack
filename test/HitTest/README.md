Wall hit test
=============

This test simulates ultra-cold neutrons hitting a wall and then shows the scattering angle distribution.

The neutrons start close to the wall of a cubic shell with fixed energy and direction and are simulated for a short time.
Then the proportion of UCN being reflected or transmitted (specularly or diffusely) are printed and the scattering angles are shown in a 2D histogram.

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
